# WindowRunner
This is a small application I made to learn CPP.
It will create a window and move and duplicate it when cursor is over it. It may crash your PC but its fun

## WARNING
This program was made purely for educational purposes and is not meant to do any harm.
The windows can be closed with Alt + F4
